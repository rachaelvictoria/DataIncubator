#Exploring STEM pipelines for underrepresented groups
Code and data for Data Incubator Challenge Questions 4/2015

##Background
The "Let Everyone Dream" campaign, recently announced at the White House Science Fair, is a 90 million (USD) multi-sector initiative to expand STEM opportunities; with a special focus on underrepresented student demographics. This initiative includes^1^:
* A 4 million (USD) commitment by Televisa, a Mexican media company, for a national television campaign improving the visibility of Latinas in STEM fields.
* A 15 million (USD) commitment by 3M corporation to fund STEM programs for women and underserved population.
* A 4 million (USD) commitment by the Motorola Solutions Foundation for innovative hands-on STEM programming for underserved students.

The push for STEM opportunities is not limited to  increasing the number of underrepresented students who choose a STEM career path. Intel recently announced a 300 million (USD) initiative^2^ to have full representation of women and minorities in the technology workforce by 2020. This funding will be used to:
* Fund programs to teach STEM to young people in underserved areas.
* Collaborate with higher education institutions.
* Invest in women and minority-owned companies.
* Create hiring and retention incentives and programs to encourage diversity within Intel.
* Collaborate with other tech companies and build out the pipeline for women and minorities into STEM careers.

##Proposal
While greater media representation, and programs to increase participation in STEM projects, will serve to improve underrepresented groups interest in pursuing a STEM career the need remains to build bridges between:
* Secondary school students underrepresented in STEM fields and undergraduate institutions
* Underrepresented undergraduate students and STEM companies or graduate programs

The proposed data analysis project would explore
* The number of STEM degrees granted at each university in the US.
* The demographic breakdown of STEM bachelors granted for each university.
* The demographic breakdown of graduating seniors in some geographic area surrounding each university.

The goal of this analysis is to identify universities that grant a large number of STEM bachelor degrees, have access to large populations of underrepresented groups in their local primary and secondary schools, and show a direct disparity between the demographics of these schools and the demographics of the post-secondary STEM degrees they are granting. These universities could then be directly targeted for funding opportunites to build a pipeline of diverse students through outreach programs, research opportunities and greater university involvement with their local schools.  
##Data
University STEM degree data was taken from IPEDS Completions Survey by Race using the NSF National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) WebCaspar table generator.
